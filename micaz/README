# MICAz wireless Sensor Network Application

You'll find the base-station application in the
the folder with the same name. To nodes' app,
go for it's folder as well. This app is using
Collection and Dissemination for it's network routing 
and it also includes deluge, which means, after the 
first time the app is installed, if reprogramming is needed,
it can be done over-the-air.

To install in a mote, first build it by typing in an terminal:  
make micaz  

After the make process, a class MicazMsg.java should be in the
node folder. If you want to process arrived data, you should include
this class in your project.

to install the app in a mote (just an example):
make micaz install.3 mib520,/dev/ttyUSB0  

 - where 3 is an axample mote number (different for each mote)  
 - mib520 is the programming interface
 - /dev/ttyUSB0 is the communication port, which might change  
 
Within the /node/Micaz.h file, you'll find the packet's content
definition. To change the network communication channel, modify
AM_MICAZMSG value. You can change the sampling time by modifying
the PERIODICITY_MULTIPLIER value.
